# Ink! Awesome DeFi


This is a Repo of Notable Smart contracts re-writen in Ink! domain (pallet-smart-contract) specific lanaguage. it outlines how production worthy smart contract should be built and structured. Smart contracts within this repo utilizes the awesome [Openbrush](https://openbrush.brushfam.io/) library of smart contract and utilities. This repo contains;

1. Uniswap V2 Ink! Implementation.
2. Synthetix staking reward contract
3. Uniswap V3 still in the works (it complicated math libs got me lazy. Ticks ðŸ˜’)


My hopes for this Repo is for it to be a good resource for engineers/teams looking to build production worth smart contracts and wish other awesome developers would build into this repo other more complicated smart contracts making this Repo more useful to a wider range of teams in the polkaDeFI space.
